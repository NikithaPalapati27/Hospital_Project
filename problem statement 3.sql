/* :  Some complaints have been lodged by patients that they have been prescribed 
hospital-exclusive medicine that they canâ€™t find elsewhere and facing problems due to that. 
Joshua, from the pharmacy management, wants to get a report of which pharmacies have prescribed 
hospital-exclusive medicines the most in the years 2021 and 2022. 
Assist Joshua to generate the report so that the pharmacies who prescribe 
hospital-exclusive medicine more often are advised to avoid such practice if possible.   */
